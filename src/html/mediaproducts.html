                <p>For this Learning outcome I made a few designs. <br>
                    I made a design for my portfolio, a design for the Fontys ICT part-time study for this one we did a desktop and mobile version. and i also made a poster for ICT part-time study. <br>
                    You will read about the process these designs. <br>

                <h1 class="page-title">Prototyping<span>.</span></h1>
                <p>I started with the landing page. This will be the people's first impression of me and my portfolio and will be most remembered. I started prototyping in Figma with the title. <br> <br>
                    The sans-serif font fits the modern/minimalistic vibe. The title is in an easy-to-read sans-serif font (Coolvetica), I also used it in my logo on the top left because it's a clean and minimalistic font, and I am going to use the Coolvetica Font in the plain text as well. <br> <br>
                    I made a box around my name to put an emphasis on it. The rectangle makes it more modern this wil add to the modern style. I also added rounded corners because it goes well with the font I chose, making the design more appealing.
                </p>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="text">
                <h1 class="page-title">Testing<span>.</span></h1>
                <p>After the landing page, I started with the rest of the layout. <br>
                    First, I had to define my goals. <br>
                    - I want to show myself in my design. <br>
                    - I need to organize all my work by the learning outcome. <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this in mind, I started looking for a way of navigating through the learning outcomes.
                    I liked the horizontal scrolling in my <a target="_blank" class="link" href="../documents/PortFolioInspiration.pdf" >inspirations</a>, so I wanted to combine it with the clipping scroll of the vertical scrolling page. <br>
                    So, I made two examples of the horizontal scrolling. Here I used the rectangle box again to maintain consistency. If you scroll on the page, it feels like a slideshow.
                </p>
                <p>As for the topic pages, I chose for less distractions only the text and some images. Maybe I'll play with the positioning of the images and text, but the main goal of these pages is to inform/educate the reader, which is best without any distractions.

                <h1 class="page-title">Improvements<span>.</span></h1>
                <p>After the first portfolio review, I got some feedback about the design.
                    To make it more myself and add some elements to make it a bit less boring,
                    I added the following elements to my design. <br>
                    I added a red accent color to my design. This will make it look more luxurious/modern.
                    Here is a link to my Figma design: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/file/WB81lQ5fnypG1bqZPdVfO8/PortFolio?type=design&node-id=491%3A9&mode=design&t=fWlbEhrXnGLmEZBS-1">Figma <i class="fa-brands fa-figma"></i></a>

                <h1 class="page-title">3D<span>.</span>Picture</h1>
                <p> 
                    I added a 3D picture of myself to make my design more memorable. It fits well with the overall style, and I've made it red to match my accent color for a striking look.
                    And to give the design a personal touch. It blends nicely with the page style. I made the model red to match my accent color, making it really stand out.

                <p>
                    The assignment was to create more awareness for the Fontys part-time ICT study. <br>
                    For this assignment, we started with creating questions, and after that, I interviewed a few people from the target audience. <br>
                    I asked them about their experience with the current website and how they experience the study, why they chose the study, and how they find this study. <br>
                    With the answers from this interview, we started the design.
                    here you have a fragment of the interview:

                <p>
                    We started making a design in figma we taught about the target audience and what they want to see on the website.
                    and what was a good way to show the information on the page. then i made it in to an interactive design witch you can see here
