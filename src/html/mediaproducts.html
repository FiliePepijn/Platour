                <p>For this Learning outcome, I made a few designs. <br>
                    I made a design for my portfolio, a design for the Fontys ICT part-time study for this one we did a desktop and mobile version. and i also made a poster for ICT part-time study. <br>

                <h1>First Design<span>.</span></h1>
                <p>
                    I made a design for my portfolio
                    which you can see in my <a href="/documents/portfoliodesign1.pdf" target="_blank" class="link">figma</a>. <br>
                    In this design, I focused on the way
                    of navigating through the learning outcome. 
                    To make this design, I started searching for inspiration, This did on different websites.
                    You can read more about <a href="../documents/PortFolioInspiration.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">my inspiration</a> Here.
                    For this inspiration,
                    I used the <a href="https://ictresearchmethods.nl/library/community-research/" target="_blank" class="link">Community research</a>.
                    This is because it's good to look what others have done for their portfolio, 
                    and maybe It's something I can use. <br>

            <div class="text">
                <h1 class="page-title">Second Design<span>.</span></h1>
                <p>After the first portfolio review, I got some feedback about the design.
                    Here is a file with the feedback and the things I did to improve them:
                    <a class="link" target="_blank"  href="../documents/PortfolioFeedback.pdf">feedback</a>. <br>
                    To make it more myself and add some elements to make it a bit less boring,
                    I added the following elements to my design. <br>
                    I added a red accent color to my design. This will make it look more luxurious/modern.
                    Here is a link to my Figma design: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="../documents/portfoliodesign2.pdf">Figma <i class="fa-brands fa-figma"></i></a>
                    and here is the .fig file, so you can text the interactive ness of the design:
                </p>
                <h1 class="page-title">3D<span>.</span>Picture</h1>
                <p> 
                    I added a 3D picture of myself to make my design more memorable. It fits well with the overall style, and I've made it red to match my accent color for a striking look.
                    And to give the design a personal touch. It blends nicely with the page style. I made the model red to match my accent color, making it really stand out.

                <p>
                    The assignment was to create more awareness for the Fontys part-time ICT study.
                    For this assignment,
                    We used 2 CMD-research methods. <br>
                    - <a href="https://ictresearchmethods.nl/field/interview" class="link" target="_blank">Interview</a>, this because when you do an interview,
                    I can get a better idea of who apply for the part-time ICT study. <br>
                    -  <a href="https://ictresearchmethods.nl/field/survey" class="link" target="_blank">Survey</a>, This because small,fast information is nice to have,
                    and with this we cloud reach more people at once.
                    We did an <a href="../documents/fontys-ovp-interview.m4a" class="link" target="_blank">interview</a>
                    and created a <a href="../documents/fontys-ovp-survey.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">survey</a>
                    on which we got thirty-one
                    <a href="../documents/fontys-ovp-antwoorden.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">answers</a>.
                    With all this information, our group started on the website design in figma,
                    and then we looked at it as a group to improve. <br>
                    We came up with the following <a href="../documents/fontys-ovp-1.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">design</a>.
                    You can find the final website at <a href="https://fontys.platour.net" class="link" target="_blank">fontys.platour.net</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then for the next project, we needed to confirm/check our design to do this.
                    We used the CMD-research method
                    <a href="https://ictresearchmethods.nl/lab/usability-testing/" class="link" target="_blank">Usability testing</a>,
                    we started with creating the <a href="../documents/fontys-ovp-answers.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">user test</a>.
                    After the user test, we went back to making a design and changed it.
                    I made a document with our process about the design 
                    which you can find <a href="../documents/fontys-ovp-usertest" class="link" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    You can find the final design of the website <a href="../documents/fontys-ovp-final.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">here</a> in pdf.
                    We also made a design for a mobile version, 
                    this is the desktop website but smaller 
                    and the navigation is turned in to a hamburger menu.
                    Here is the <a href="../documents/fontys-ovp-phone.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">mobile figma</a> in pdf

            <h2>Sprint<span>.</span>X</h2>
            <div class="text">

                <h1 class="page-title" >First<span>.</span>prototype</h1>
                <p>
                    For sprint-X, I designed and coded a terminal-style portfolio website for Jasper Latour,
                    a technology student in his second semester.
                    Jasper wants his portfolio to feature a command line interface (CLI) for navigation.
                    I started by designing the website in Adobe XD based on his preferences.
                    <br>
                    After presenting the initial design, Jasper wanted that the portfolio be accessible to others,
                    so I added a hamburger menu for easier navigation.
                    <br>
                    After an interview,
                    Jasper expressed a preference for a modern Linux terminal aesthetic with purple and gray colors
                    and wanted a normal navbar.
                    I researched modern Linux terminal designs and found the modern linux terminal colors,
                    making the terminal a loose part of the website.
                    All design iterations and interviews with Jasper are documented in the Adobe XD file and my research document.
                    And for the final design in the <a href="../documents/sprint-x-xdfile.xd" class="link" target="_blank">Adobe XD</a>, I made it interactive.
                    Here you can find <a href="../documents/sprint-x-research.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">the full research document</a>.
