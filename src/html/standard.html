            <p>
                I didn't make a planning for the assignments I did before Sprint-X.
                Because I thought I could manage my time well without a plan.
                My planning for this semester was mainly just google calendar,
                this to check when i had time to work on the projects.
                For the most part, I could do every task, but I didn't have anything to keep track of the tasks I did and still had to do.
                <br><br>
                For Sprint-X, though, I had to make a weekly plan because it was required for the assignment.
                This helped a lot with keeping track of all the tasks.
                This schedule made it easier to plan ahead.
                It also made <a href="../documents/sprint-x-planning.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">planning for sprint X</a> it easier for me to contact my stakeholder.
                Here is my planning for sprint X.

            <h1>Communication</h1>
            <p>
                We started with the assignment, and we divided the tasks equally.
                It was hard keeping track of all the tasks we did
                and still had to do since we didn't make a trello or something similar.
                But the communication between group members was good,
                so I could easily ask someone what still had to be done.
                I mostly used whatsapp for the team communication since this was the fastest way to get a response.
                I used Teams mostly for sending documents, and for talking to teachers and stakeholders.

                I believe adopting a more structured system like Trello
                or using other SCRUM methodologies would improve our way of working.
                Because with trello, I can keep track of all the tasks we need to do and are already done.
                It would enhance the way we work as a group, and it can improve the way tasks are divided.
                I can, for example, choose tasks I need as evidence for my portfolio.

            <h1>CMD<span>.</span>methods</h1>
            <p>
                For all my projects, I based my research on the DOT framework.
                I used CMD methods to find the right information in a fast and efficient way.
                It helped me to determine what information was important and what not,
                and what tasks I needed to do.
                You can find the usage of the DOT framework in my research files, these are linked with the assignment.

                The reports I wrote are all linked in my portfolio.
                You can see this in all the other learning outcomes.
                I also presented the Beat Box brand for the stakeholder and I got some feedback about this.
                You can see this in <a href="../documents/BB-feedback-ppt.pdf" target="_blank" class="link">my
                document</a> for the Beat Box project.

                For the sprint-X project, I made a video to show my projects journey.
