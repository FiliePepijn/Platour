                <p>For this Learning outcome i made many iterations.<br>
                   If you read the first learning outcome you can see i made a design for my portfolio but i also made a logo and poster.
                   thats what i will show you here. <br>

            <p>
                For this assignment we had to make a branding for the Fontys SoundLab. <br>
                The Stakeholder had a problem that the SoundLab was not known by the students or he atleast wanted it to be used more.
                so we created a brand and a awwareness campaign. <br>

        <div class="text">
            <h1 class="page-title">Logo<span>.</span> </h1>
            we started creating diffenent logo's. eventually we put all the logo's in a survey and let the target audience make the decision.
            on the right you see the logo's i made. i made 3 logo's and asked josh wich one he liked most this one i put in the survey.<br>

            <p>
                My first logo is a more modern/minimalistic logo because it has no doodles or other random elements. I made this modern minimalistic because many people like the modern vibe.
Here you  see the element above the text. it represents a sound wave. This reconnects to the sound because there you can make sound.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>For this design I went for a more playful vibe but still minimalistic. The lines at the top and by the exclamation mark make the logo more playful as well as the font the letters are rotated.
                I also brought a sound wave in the o from box as lines.

            <p>
                This is more of a warm and cozy design. 
                It is a retro font. The colours make it more cozy and warm. I made a line above the retro text to connect the logo to the audio lab. This line represents a sound wave.
                This is also the logo that was chosen josh, So i chose this one to put in the survey. <br> <br>

                When we took the survey we got 15 answers that said this is the most appealing logo. With this knowledge we know that the target audience wanted a retro/cozy vibe.
                here is a link to the survey answers: <a class="link" target="_blank"  href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QZRh3velDxNlqbArk2B1NMjtyGgZEFFmky66srMnEXw/edit?usp=sharing">Survey</a>

            <h1 class="page-title">Poster<span>.</span> </h1>
            <p>
                after the logo was chosen i made a poster for the soundlab based on the Retro/Cozy fibe the target audience chose. 
                Here you see the poster that I made.
I used the logo and added the sound lab text. this so it is more clear that it is for a sound lab. I also gave some examples of what the sound lab can be used for. And the sheet music line makes the biggest connection with the sound lab. The overall poster is like a photo from an instant camera this enhances the retro feel of the poster.

            <h1 class="page-title" class="prototyping">Prototyping<span>.</span> </h1>
            <p>I started with the landing page. This will be the peoples first impression of me and my portfolio. And will be most remembered. I started prototyping in Figma with the tile. <br> <br>
                and a sans serif font this fits the modern/minimalistic vibe The title Is in a easy to read sans-serif font (coolvetica). I also used it in my logo on the top left. This because itâ€™s a clean an minimalistic font. And I am going to use the Coolvetica Font in the plain text as well. <br> <br>
                I made a box around my name to put an emphasis on it. The rectangle makes it more modern because of the clean modern line. I also added the rounded corners this because it goes well with the font I chose. And rounded corners make the design more appealing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h1 class="page-title" class="testing" >Testing<span>.</span> </h1>
            <p>After the landing page I started with the rest of the layout <br>
                First I had to define my goals. <br>
                -   I want to show myself in my design. <br>
                -	I need to organize all my work by the learning outcome <br>
                </p>
                <p>With this in mind i started looking a way of navigating through the learning outcome. 
                    I liked the horizontal scrolling in my inspirations so I wanted to combine it with the clipping scroll of the vertical scrolling page. <br>
                    So I made 2 examples of the horizontal scrolling. Here I used the rectangle box again to maintain consistency. If you scroll on the page it feels like a slide show. 
                    A slide show in the lay out will enhance the memorability of my portfolio.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    As of the topic pages. I chose for no distractions only the text and some images maby play with the positioning of the images and text but the main goal of these pages is to inform/educate the reader and this is best without any distractions.
                </p>

        <div class="text">
            <h1 class="page-title" class="improvements">Improvements<span>.</span> </h1>
            <p>After the first portfolio review I got some feedback about the design.
                To make it more myself and add some elements to make it a bit less boring.
                So I added the following elements to my design. <br>
                First I added the stickers to enhance the overall uniqueness of my design. These are pictures that represent moments or elements of my life. This way it is more me and a bit less boring.
                Also I added a red accent colour to my design. This will make it look more luxurious/modern. 

                here is a link to my figma design: <a class="link" target="_blank"  href="https://www.figma.com/file/WB81lQ5fnypG1bqZPdVfO8/PortFolio?type=design&node-id=491%3A9&mode=design&t=fWlbEhrXnGLmEZBS-1"> Figma <i class="fa-brands fa-figma"></i></a>

        <div class="image-container">

        <div class="text">
            <h1 class="page-title" class="3dpicture">3D<span>.</span>Picture</h1>
            <p> 
                I added a 3D picture of myself to make my design more memorable. It fits well with the overall style, and I've made it red to match my accent color for a striking look.
                And to give the design a personal touch. It blends nicely with the page style. I made the model red to match my accent color, making it really stand out.
