                <p>
                    For this assignment, we had to create branding for the Fontys SoundLab.<br>
                    The stakeholder had a problem: the SoundLab was not well-known among students, and they wanted it to be used more.
                    So, we created a brand and an awareness campaign. <br>

                <h1 class="page-title">Logo<span>.</span></h1>
                <p>We started creating different logos. Eventually, we put all the logos in a survey and let the target audience make the decision.
                   On the right, you see the logos I made. I made 3 logos and asked Josh which one he liked most; this one I put in the survey.<br>

                <p>
                    My first logo is a more modern/minimalistic logo because it has no doodles or other random elements.
                    I made this modern minimalistic because many people like the modern vibe.
                    Here you see the element above the text. It represents a sound wave, reconnecting to the sound because there you can make sound.
                </p>
                <p>For this design, I went for a more playful vibe but still minimalistic. The lines at the top and by the exclamation mark make the logo more playful as well as the font; the letters are rotated.
                    I also brought a sound wave into the 'o' from 'box' as lines.

                    This is more of a warm and cozy design.
                    It is a retro font. The colors make it more cozy and warm. I made a line above the retro text to connect the logo to the audio lab. This line represents a sound wave.
                    This is also the logo that was chosen by Josh, so I chose this one to put in the survey.<br><br>

                    When we took the survey, we got 15 answers that said this is the most appealing logo. With this knowledge, we know that the target audience wanted a retro/cozy vibe.
                    Here is a link to the survey answers: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QZRh3velDxNlqbArk2B1NMjtyGgZEFFmky66srMnEXw/edit?usp=sharing">Survey</a>

                <p>
                    After the logo was chosen, I made a poster for the SoundLab based on the retro/cozy vibe the target audience chose.
                    Here you see the poster that I made.
                    I used the logo and added the SoundLab text to make it clearer that it is for a SoundLab.
                    I also gave some examples of what the SoundLab can be used for. The sheet music line makes the biggest connection with the SoundLab.
                    The overall poster is like a photo from an instant camera, enhancing the retro feel of the poster.
