                <p>Meet Pepijn Latour, a student from Jan van Brabant College HAVO, whose educational journey led him to explore a variety of interests. Initially drawn to the complexities of accountancy, Pepijn discovered his passion for ICT, influenced by his family's background in the field. As a member of Scouting Paulus, he enjoys socializing and organizing activities like the chip shop game. At home, Pepijn indulges in science fiction series like Lupin and Stranger Things and enjoys gaming, with favorites including Overwatch and Minecraft.</p>

                <p>Balancing his studies with a part-time job at Jan Linders/Albert Heijn, Pepijn contemplates between pursuing Media Design or Technology for his further studies. Intrigued by the creative direction of ICT, he is particularly drawn to Media Design, where he sees potential in expressing his creativity through photography and film. However, the allure of technology remains strong, presenting Pepijn with a delightful dilemma as he navigates his future academic and professional path.</p>
