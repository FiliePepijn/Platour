                <p>My name is Pepijn Latour, and I come from the HAVO of the Jan van Brabant college. I attended school there for 4 years, and in the 3rd year, I opted for the Economics and Society profile, with the subjects: mathematics-A, geography, and computer science. When I started looking into my further studies, my first choice was not initially what I wanted, as I initially wanted to study Accountancy because the economy and its operation really appealed to me. However, because I find economics very difficult, I decided not to choose this.</p>

                <p>I was in doubt because I find ICT very interesting. ICT runs in the family. My father is an electrician; he installs security. My brother is also studying ICT at Fontys; he is now in the 2nd semester and has chosen technology as his specialization. I also have a sister who is now in high school, and she probably wants to become a graphic designer. My mother works in childcare in Helmond and the surrounding area. So I chose ICT because it really appeals to me and I really enjoy doing it. Working with the code and the creative aspects of it is very interesting.</p>
                
                <p>I also belong to Scouting Paulus, where I actually go every Friday, when there is a bar evening where many members go to have a nice drink. And every 2 weeks we have a shooting evening with the Rover Scouts; this is the group I am in; on such an evening, someone has to come up with a program, for example, the chip shop game in which groups have to judge chip shops in the area.</p>
                
                <p>When I'm at home, I like to watch a series or play a game. I especially like science fiction and detectives, so I have rewatched Lupin and Stranger Things several times. In terms of games, I think Overwatch, COD, and Battlefield 2042 are very cool and fun to play. I can also keep myself busy with Minecraft, so I have my own Minecraft server at home, on which there is a modded server with the Cave Factory modpack.</p>
                
                <p>I work at Jan Linders/Albert Heijn in Mierlo-Hout, where I usually work 2 to 3 days a week. As an in-depth study, I want to choose Media Design because I think it would be fun to choose the creative direction of ICT. I can't draw very well myself, but taking photos and films seems very interesting and challenging. However, I still doubt whether I might want to choose technology after all because this also seems very fun and interesting.</p>
