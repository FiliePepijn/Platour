            <p>for this learning outcome i also asked for feedback on sertain things. mostly this was a problem that i coudn't solve myself.
                i asked for feedback on my design and the way i wrote my code. i also asked for feedback on my research and the way i used the CMD-methods.

            <p>Reflecting on my work is important to me. It helps me see what I did well and what I can improve. I'll show you how I reflect on my work.
            at first i thing i did well and what i made for the project is good.
            for the next project i would like to work more on the documentation becouse i dropped the ball there. i had to do all my documentation on the end this is not a good way to work.

            <h1>Growth<span>.</span></h1>
            <p> this semester i learned a lot of new this like the cmd methods and how to use these in a simple form. 
                further i learned some development skill like the emmet intergration in html and most important off all i learned how to understand Javascipt, i think this can really upgrade the things i can make since i am intrested in 3d design.
            </p>
            <p>
                To see what i can do with all my knowledge in ICT i went to the Fontys-ICT Careerday. here therewere a bunch of company's that i could talk to and ask questions about what they do and what they are looking for in a new employee. and what i could do inside of their company.
