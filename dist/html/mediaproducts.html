                <p>For this Learning outcome i made a few designs. <br>
                   i made a design for my portfolio and for fontys partime ICT.
                   Both of the design i tested and improved with feedback from the tests.
                   my portfolio design is maily tested with my teachers and classmates.
                   For the website of fontys partime ICT i tested it with the target audience for this assignment.

            <h1 class="page-title" class="prototyping">Prototyping<span>.</span> </h1>
            <p>I started with the landing page. This will be the peoples first impression of me and my portfolio. And will be most remembered. I started prototyping in Figma with the tile. <br> <br>
                and a sans serif font this fits the modern/minimalistic vibe The title Is in a easy to read sans-serif font (coolvetica). I also used it in my logo on the top left. This because itâ€™s a clean an minimalistic font. And I am going to use the Coolvetica Font in the plain text as well. <br> <br>
                I made a box around my name to put an emphasis on it. The rectangle makes it more modern because of the clean modern line. I also added the rounded corners this because it goes well with the font I chose. And rounded corners make the design more appealing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <h1 class="page-title" class="testing" >Testing<span>.</span> </h1>
            <p>After the landing page I started with the rest of the layout <br>
                First I had to define my goals. <br>
                -   I want to show myself in my design. <br>
                -	I need to organize all my work by the learning outcome <br>
                </p>
                <p>With this in mind i started looking a way of navigating through the learning outcome. 
                    I liked the horizontal scrolling in my inspirations so I wanted to combine it with the clipping scroll of the vertical scrolling page. <br>
                    So I made 2 examples of the horizontal scrolling. Here I used the rectangle box again to maintain consistency. If you scroll on the page it feels like a slide show. 
                    A slide show in the lay out will enhance the memorability of my portfolio.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    As of the topic pages. I chose for no distractions only the text and some images maby play with the positioning of the images and text but the main goal of these pages is to inform/educate the reader and this is best without any distractions.
                </p>

            <h1 class="page-title" class="improvements">Improvements<span>.</span> </h1>
            <p>After the first portfolio review I got some feedback about the design.
                To make it more myself and add some elements to make it a bit less boring.
                So I added the following elements to my design. <br>
                First I added the stickers to enhance the overall uniqueness of my design. These are pictures that represent moments or elements of my life. This way it is more me and a bit less boring.
                Also I added a red accent colour to my design. This will make it look more luxurious/modern. 

                here is a link to my figma design: <a class="link" target="_blank"  href="https://www.figma.com/file/WB81lQ5fnypG1bqZPdVfO8/PortFolio?type=design&node-id=491%3A9&mode=design&t=fWlbEhrXnGLmEZBS-1"> Figma <i class="fa-brands fa-figma"></i></a>

            <h1 class="page-title" class="3dpicture">3D<span>.</span>Picture</h1>
            <p> 
                I added a 3D picture of myself to make my design more memorable. It fits well with the overall style, and I've made it red to match my accent color for a striking look.
                And to give the design a personal touch. It blends nicely with the page style. I made the model red to match my accent color, making it really stand out.

                The assignment was to create more awwareness for the fontys parttime ICT study. <br>
                For this assignment we started with creating questions after that I interviewed a few people from the target audience. <br>
                I asked them about their experience with the current website and how they experience the study. Why they chose the study, and how they find this study <br>
                Wit the answers of this interview we started the design.
